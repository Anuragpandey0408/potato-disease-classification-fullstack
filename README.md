# Potato Disease Classifier Fullstack
This project focuses on classifying potato plant diseases using deep learning techniques. Early detection of plant diseases is essential for increasing crop yield and reducing economic loss. By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), this project aims to provide an automated solution for identifying potato leaf diseases with high accuracy.

# Project Overview

Developed a deep learning model to classify potato leaf images into categories:

Healthy

Early Blight

Late Blight

Implemented using TensorFlow / Keras (or PyTorch if you used that).

Trained on the PlantVillage dataset (Potato subset).
